# num-exercise
A LaTeX Template for the exercise sheets mainly used for numerical analysis lectures at the JGU Mainz (not official!).

## Preliminaries

This latex class file requires the `exsheets` package. 
Since most latex distributions use fairly old package versions (I'm looking at you, debian!), I've put it as a git submodule into this repository.
Alternatively, you can also get it from [here](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/exsheets).

Further the JGU Logo is required. 
Since that probably has a copyright, I'm not going to put it into this repository. 
Instead you can download it [here](http://www.zdv.uni-mainz.de/uni-intern/corporate_design/logos/JGU-Logo_farbe_cmyk.eps) and rename it to `logo.eps` or simply use this wget oneliner
  
    wget http://www.zdv.uni-mainz.de/uni-intern/corporate_design/logos/JGU-Logo_farbe_cmyk.eps -O logo.eps
